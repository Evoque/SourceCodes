## Key Points
- React Router pre-v4 was static(mostly): declare your routes as part of your app's initialization before any rendering takes place.
- **Dynamic Routing**: routing takes place `as your app is rendering`, not in a configuration or convention outside of a running app. That means almost everything is a component in React Router.
